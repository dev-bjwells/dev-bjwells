## Hi there👋

My name is Brandon, a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer who has worked within the industry for over a decade. Throughout my career as a programmer, I've worn many hats&mdash;project lead, developer, designer, and marketer. Along the way, I gained valuable skills beyond coding, including design, marketing and project management, which have become crucial assets that made me stand out among my peers.
